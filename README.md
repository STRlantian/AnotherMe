# AnotherMe

A 2D RPG game with Unity

This is the first time I develop a game with Unity

And actually im a little young to write codes so pls give feedback if there are problems

-Warning-

This game DOES NOT contain any scary, disturbing elements

which means there are NO jumpscares, suddenly-appear-on-the-screen eyes and stuff like them

This game should be provided for FREE on itch.io (maybe on steam later)
