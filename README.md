# AnotherMe ✨

* __*A world exists if it is imagined by many people*__
* A 2D RPG game made with Unity ~~(世界一阶魔方协会)~~
* The first time I develop a game with Unity  
* New to code so pls give feedback if there are issues

-Warning-

* This game _DOES NOT_ contain any scary, disturbing elements  
* which means there are NO jumpscares, suddenly-appear-on-the-screen eyes and stuff like them(Really)
* This game should be provided for FREE
* I was unable to get some of the copyright of the original version of the remixed music.
* So if you are ome of the author of them pls contact me with the email on my mainpage.
* There should be CHN version first and this repository will be the ENG version
* CHN version should come out before the ENG version(bcs the translator now is also STRlantian TwT)
