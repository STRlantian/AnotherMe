# AnotherMe ✨

* A 2D RPG game made with Unity
* This is the first time I develop a game with Unity  
* And actually im a little young to write codes so pls give feedback if there are issues

-Warning-  

* This game _DOES NOT_ contain any scary, disturbing elements  
* which means there are NO jumpscares, suddenly-appear-on-the-screen eyes and stuff like them(Really)
* This game should be provided for FREE on itch.io (maybe on Steam later)
