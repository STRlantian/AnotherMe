ANOTHER ME 

Story: 1st view:
I -> some1 -> different
I am not like normal boy in common thoughts
Fear of darkness, low voice, too quiet, too stubborn, and wired art styles..
All of these made me unable to get along with others sometimes
However, I dare not to do anything to change.
Because changing them in my mind means..
I am not myself anymore.
